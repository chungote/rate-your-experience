Once MySql is installed, you need to create a database named “rye”:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE rye;

Next, create a user named “rye”, and create a secure password in place of ‘password’ in the example below:
CREATE USER 'rye'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Next you will grant privileges for that user:

GRANT ALL ON rye.* TO 'rye'@'localhost';

Remember the password you created…we will need it when editing the configuration file!
